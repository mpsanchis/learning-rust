# About variables

Variables are immutable by default. One name bound to one variable. This is changeable by adding `mut` when declaring a variable (`let mut x = 5`).

Tuples can contain different types.
Arrays contain a fixed number of elements.

Rust distinguishes between statements (definitions, assignments) and expressions (which return a value). If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.
