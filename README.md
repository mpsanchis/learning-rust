# Learning Rust

As a personal goal, I decided to learn rust in 2024.

This repo contains a summary of the rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), chapter by chapter, with code examples from everything I read. 

Disclaimer: there will be typos, as well as code that is not present in the book, as I wrote and coded everything manually.
